The Arduino micro controller is a way to work with analog and digital circuits. The Arduino can interface with computers via com and USB ports. There is a scripting Arduino IDE which runs off C++ (C?) code. The scripts allow for programing to control the Arduino and thus the circuits.

My first experience with Arduino was the junior year of my physics degree. Most of the class was dedicated to analog circuit basics and components. At the very end we integrated the Arduino for control of analog circuits.

Since then, I have worked a little bit further on my own time. I've been able to create and control several analog and digital circuits:

* Lighting LEDs via NES controller
* Controlling LEDs via Arduino scripts
* Made a dice rolling program based off number of LED lights illuminated randomly
* Controlling Christmas lights
* etc
