The Raspberry Pi is a British micro-computer that can run an OS (Linux by default) and has USB, HDMI, and audio ports to boot! 

For a quick intro, these are the tasks/projects I've been able to accomplish thus far:
* Run RetroPie; a video game emulator OS - so much fun!
* Run a desktop image (OS) similar to a laptop
* Run Python scripts and Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica app
* Control analog and digital circuits
* Surf the internet
